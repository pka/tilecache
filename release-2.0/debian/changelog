tilecache (1.9) unstable; urgency=low
  * Fix longstanding bug which made some non-geographic projections difficult
    to create tiles with
  * Add more informative error message output via TileCacheExceptions  
  * Fix for "MetaLayer.getMetaSize is too conservative"
  * Report OSErrors more cleanly in tilecache_clean.py
  * Better support for Jython in DiskCache class.
  * Add support for extent_type=loose to allow out of bounds tile requests
  * Improved tilecache_seed to only grab one metaTile from each set -- 
    this drastically reduces the number of requests to precache metatiled
    layers. Also fixed off-by-one error where seed was requesting too many
    tiles.
  * Add tms_type=google to specify that the TMS layer should go down instead
    of up.
  * Add setting of labelcache_map_edge_buffer to the MapServer layer if one
    does not exist on the map object.
  * Make mapnik layer respect layers= config if provided.
  * Remove getClosestLevel, no longer used or neccesary.  
  * Better Lockfile removal, from Paul Spencer
  * Update WMS Capabilities, from Steven Ottens
  * Only use metaTiling if metatile=yes, true, or 1 
  * Minor change to WMS layer dispatching to handle GDAL WMS Driver 
   compatability.

tilecache (1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apache will sometimes kill TileCache, leaving around locks. If we can't 
    lock for > cache.timeout seconds, throw an exception with the lockname,
    so that users can cleanup. Reported by Brock Anderson, who had stuck locks
    for several days.
  * If ImageLayer base image is transparent, make output Image transparent too.
    Report and patch by Brian Victor.
  * Add support for forcing client to reload on errors, by Suki Hirata.
  * Add support for not caching data which is not images for WMS, with
    original support written by Suki Hirata.
  * Minor fixups to TMS metadata, from Suki Hirata.
