tilecache (1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low
 
  * Patch to ImageLayer from Volker Mische add:

      the images to be transparent outside the maxExtent of the image.
    * Resize scaling method specification 
  * Add support for tile watermarking, patch by Andrew Hughes. 
  * Allow for definition of 'styles' parameter in WMSLayer tilecache
    cfg -- don't send blank parameters to the backend.

tilecache (1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apache will sometimes kill TileCache, leaving around locks. If we can't 
    lock for > cache.timeout seconds, throw an exception with the lockname,
    so that users can cleanup. Reported by Brock Anderson, who had stuck locks
    for several days.
  * If ImageLayer base image is transparent, make output Image transparent too.
    Report and patch by Brian Victor.
  * Add support for forcing client to reload on errors, by Suki Hirata.
  * Add support for not caching data which is not images for WMS, with
    original support written by Suki Hirata.
  * Minor fixups to TMS metadata, from Suki Hirata.
