 * Add support for MapnikLayer for rendering.
 * Add support for rendering using metatiles: instead of rendering one tile
   at a time, render a 5x5 tileset, and then slice the tiles up. Good for
   vector layers, where labels crossing tile boundaries is useful. 
   To turn on, use 'metaTile=yes' in layer definition. Requires 
   Python-Imaging.

 * Change cache to use local layer name for creating caches instead of

   where the local layer name does not match the remote layer name,
   you should move your directory after installing tilecache-1.1.
