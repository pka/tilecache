TileCache Caches
================

TileCache offers access to a number of different caches. These caches are used
to store tiles. 

Disk
----
Example Configuration::

  [cache]
  type=Disk
  base=/var/lib/tilecache
  umask=002

Dependancies: None

Memcached
---------
Example configuration::

  [cache]
  type=Memcached
  servers=127.0.0.1:11211

Dependencies:
 * memcache Python module must be installed on your system path.

Amazon S3
---------
Example configuration::

  [cache]
  type=AWSS3
  access_key=833833ABC88838
  secret_access_key=8234abyi3kdjby8so8idu

This cache can use one of two libraries:

Boto
____
Available from http://code.google.com/p/boto/, boto is a package that 
wraps the Amazon APIs in a Pythonic wrapper. This is installable on
recent Debian-based distributions as python-boto. It can be installed
via easy_install from setuptools as well: simply easy_install boto.
The boto library is more complete, and is more likely to properly
handle error conditions than the Amazon Example Library.

Amazon Example Library
______________________
Amazon provides an example Python library. This library provides a simple
wrapper around the Amazon web services. The code is available from 
http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=134&categoryID=47

You must download, unpack, and place the s3-example-libraries/python/S3.py
file on your PYTHONPATH/sys.path. The source distribution of TileCache
includes this file in the TileCache/Caches/S3.py file. (Packagers are
encouraged to remove this file from distributions and instead depend
on the boto library described above.)
